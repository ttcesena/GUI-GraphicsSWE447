Project Overview
-I would like to do my final project on a physics based application using the Physijs addon from THREE.js. 
Just like a carnival game, I'd like to make an application where the user would be able to throw an object, probably a ball, and knock over some other objects that are on a stand. I would also texture these objects to go along with the theme I have in mind. A stretch goal that I'd have for this would that there would be multiple levels going up in difficulty as the user progressed.

Step Sequence
1. Research and essentially teach myself how the javascript libraries that I'm going to use work.
2. Render out the objects that I'd like to use in the scene.
3. Refine the look of said objects, including texturing,positioning, and size.
4. Implement the physics side to the objects, so that they can interact with each other and the environment.
5.(Stretch Goal) Add progression through multiple levels.

How I'll Implement
-After looking through what THREE.js had to offer, the Physijs addon really interested me so I'd like to use it for my project.
